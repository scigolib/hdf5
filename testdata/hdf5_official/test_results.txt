Official HDF5 Test Suite Results
========================================
Date:      2025-11-13 (v0.12.0 release)
Total:     433 files
Pass:      380 files
Fail:      7 files (unsupported features - user blocks, SOHM, etc.)
Skip:      46 files (multi-file formats, legacy, truly corrupted)

Breakdown:
- Valid single-file HDF5: 387 files (433 - 39 multi - 1 legacy - 6 corrupt)
- Pass:      380 files (98.2% of valid single-file)
- Fail:      7 files (valid HDF5, but unsupported features)
- Skip:      46 files (39 multi-file + 1 legacy + 6 corrupted)

Pass Rate: 98.2% (380/387 valid single-file HDF5)
Duration:  ~60ms
========================================

Note: The 7 "failed" files are valid HDF5 that the C library reads
successfully, but use features we don't yet support (user blocks,
SOHM shared headers, FSM persistence, etc.). These are deferred to
v0.13.0+. Impact is minimal (~1-2% of real-world files).
