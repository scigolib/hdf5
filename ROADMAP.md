# HDF5 Go Library - Development Roadmap

> **Strategic Advantage**: We have official HDF5 C library as reference implementation!
> **Approach**: Port proven algorithms, not invent from scratch - Senior Go Developer mindset

**Last Updated**: 2025-11-01 | **Current Version**: v0.11.3-beta | **Strategy**: Feature-complete at v0.12.0-rc.1, then community testing → v1.0.0 stable | **Target**: v0.12.0-rc.1 (2026-03-15) → v1.0.0 stable (2026-07+)

---

## 🎯 Vision

Build a **production-ready, pure Go HDF5 library** with full read/write capabilities, leveraging the battle-tested HDF5 C library as our reference implementation.

### Key Advantages

✅ **Reference Implementation Available**
- Official HDF5 C library at `D:\projects\scigolibs\hdf5c\src` (30+ years of development)
- Well-documented algorithms and data structures
- Proven edge case handling
- Community knowledge base

✅ **Not Starting From Scratch**
- Port existing algorithms with Go best practices
- Use C library test cases for validation
- Follow established conventions
- Learn from production experience
- **Senior Developer approach**: Understand, adapt, improve

✅ **Faster Development**
- Direct code translation when appropriate
- Existing bug fixes and optimizations
- Clear implementation patterns
- 10x productivity with go-senior-architect agent

## 🚀 Version Strategy (UPDATED 2025-10-30)

### Philosophy: Feature-Complete → Community Testing → Stable

```
v0.10.0-beta (READ complete) ✅ RELEASED 2025-10-29
         ↓ (2-3 months)
v0.11.x-beta (WRITE features) → Incremental write features
         ↓ (1-2 months)
v0.12.0-rc.1 (FEATURE COMPLETE) 🎯 KEY MILESTONE
         ↓ (2-3 months community testing)
v0.12.x-rc.x (bug fixes) → Patch releases based on feedback
         ↓ (proven stable + user validation)
v1.0.0-rc.1 → Final validation (API proven in production)
         ↓ (community approval)
v1.0.0 STABLE → Production release (all HDF5 formats supported!)
```

### Critical Milestones

**v0.12.0-rc.1** = ALL features done + API stable
- This is where we freeze API
- This is where community testing begins
- After this: ONLY bug fixes, no new features
- Path to v1.0.0 is validation and stability

**v1.0.0** = Production with ALL HDF5 format support
- Supports HDF5 v0, v2, v3 superblocks ✅
- Ready for their future HDF5 2.0.0 format (will be added in v1.x.x updates)
- Ultra-modern library = all formats from day one!
- Our v2.0.0 = only if WE change Go API (not HDF5 formats!)

**See**: `docs/dev/notes/VERSIONING_STRATEGY.md` for complete strategy

## 📊 Current Status (v0.11.3-beta)

### ✅ What's Working Now

**Read Support** (100%):
- ✅ All HDF5 formats (superblock v0, v2, v3)
- ✅ All datatypes (basic, arrays, enums, references, opaque, strings)
- ✅ All layouts (compact, contiguous, chunked)
- ✅ All storage types (compact, dense with fractal heap + B-tree v2)
- ✅ Compression (GZIP/Deflate)
- ✅ Object headers (v1, v2) with continuation blocks
- ✅ Groups (symbol table, dense, compact)
- ✅ Attributes (compact 0-7, dense 8+)

**Write Support** (80%):
- ✅ File creation (Truncate/Exclusive modes)
- ✅ Superblock v0 and v2 writing
- ✅ Object Header v1 and v2 writing
- ✅ Dataset writing (contiguous, chunked)
- ✅ All datatypes (basic, arrays, enums, references, opaque, strings)
- ✅ GZIP compression, Shuffle filter
- ✅ Group creation (symbol table, dense)
- ✅ Attribute writing (compact 0-7, dense 8+)
- ✅ **Dense Storage RMW** (read-modify-write cycle complete!)
- ✅ Free space management
- ⚠️ Attribute modification/deletion (not yet)
- ⚠️ Soft/external links (not yet)
- ⚠️ Indirect blocks for fractal heap (not yet)

**Quality Metrics**:
- 86.1% test coverage (target: >70%) ✅
- All core tests passing (100%) ✅
- Linter: 7 acceptable warnings ✅
- Cross-platform (Linux, macOS, Windows) ✅

**History**: See [CHANGELOG.md](CHANGELOG.md) for complete release history
